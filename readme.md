## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
Google Colab (recommended) or Jupyter Notebook
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/estregan/home-insurance-pricing.git
cd home-insurance-pricing

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Model
1. Open `home_insurance_pricing.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Model will generate synthetic data automatically
4. Results saved to `home_insurance_pricing_model.pkl`

## 📈 Model Validation

### Cross-Validation Results
- 5-Fold CV R²: 0.68 ± 0.03
- No significant overfitting detected
- Consistent performance across folds

### Business Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error: $134.67
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 11.5%
- Within industry benchmarks for pricing accuracy

## 💡 Lessons Applied

From previous projects:
1. **Data validation first** - Always check before modeling
2. **Memory optimization** - Reduced usage by 50%
3. **Realistic expectations** - R² of 0.60-0.70 is good for insurance
4. **Business focus** - ROI and actionable insights
5. **No perfect accuracy trap** - Added noise prevents overfitting

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Real Data Integration
- [ ] Source actual insurance dataset
- [ ] Validate data quality
- [ ] Retrain models

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Geographic risk factors
- [ ] Weather pattern integration
- [ ] Competitive pricing analysis

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
- [ ] API development
- [ ] Model monitoring
- [ ] A/B testing framework

## 📊 Synthetic Data Generation

Current version uses synthetic data with:
- 10,000 sample policies
- 12 base features + 6 engineered features
- Realistic distributions (log-normal home values, Poisson claims)
- Known relationships for validation
- Added noise to prevent overfitting

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This version uses **synthetic data** for demonstration
- Real-world performance may vary
- Always validate with actual data before production use
- Model requires regular retraining (quarterly recommended)
